# Privacy Policy for MicroPDF

**Last Updated:** [Insert Today's Date]

MicroPDF ("we", "our", or "the extension") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our Chrome Extension handles your data.

## 1. Data Collection and Usage
**We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data.**

MicroPDF runs entirely locally on your device using secure client-side JavaScript.
When you open a PDF with MicroPDF:
* The file is processed within your browser's memory.
* The file is never uploaded to any external server.
* All edits, signatures, and form fillings happen offline.

## 2. Permissions
To function correctly, MicroPDF requires specific browser permissions. Here is how they are used:

* **`activeTab` / Host Permissions:** Used strictly to read the PDF file data from the tab you are currently viewing so it can be displayed in the editor. This access is temporary and occurs only when you activate the extension.
* **`contextMenus`:** Used to add the "Open in MicroPDF" option to your right-click menu.
* **`downloads`:** Used solely to allow you to save your edited PDF file back to your local computer.

## 3. Third-Party Services
MicroPDF does not use any third-party analytics, tracking scripts, or advertising services.

## 4. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will update the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy.
